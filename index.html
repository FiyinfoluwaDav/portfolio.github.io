      <h3>Obstacle Avoidance Car</h3>
      <p>I developed an obstacle avoidance robot designed to navigate through environments autonomously. Equipped with sensors and motors, the robot detects and avoids obstacles in real-time, ensuring smooth and efficient movement. This project involved integrating various components, such as sensors for obstacle detection, raspberry pi pico micro controller and and motors for movement. The result is a robust and reliable system capable of maneuvering through various terrains with minimal human intervention.</p>

      <h3>Smart Wastebin</h3>
      <p>I created a smart waste bin that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor to streamline waste management. The ultrasonic sensor measures the fill level of the bin, while the servo motor controls the lid's opening and closing. When the bin is full, the sensor triggers the servo to open the lid, facilitating easy disposal of waste. This project emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, combining basic components to enhance the functionality of a traditional waste bin.</p>

      <h3>Hand Detection And Finger Tracking</h3>
      <p>I developed a hand tracking and finger detection system using MediaPipe to analyze and interpret hand movements in real-time. Leveraging MediaPipe's advanced computer vision capabilities, the system accurately tracks hand positions and identifies individual fingers with high precision. This project involves capturing live video input, processing the frames to detect hand landmarks, and providing feedback on hand gestures and finger movements. The result is an intuitive and responsive system that can be applied to various applications, from interactive user interfaces to gesture-controlled devices.</p>
